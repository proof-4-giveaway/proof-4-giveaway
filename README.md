# i do pony town giveaways because i am rich and bored.

### when i host a game, it is likely that you will earn something of value as a winner, whether it is a team game or a solo game.

#

### im planning to host squid game next. $50 is on the line. if you see this while i am advertising...

### Yes, I am serious. Please invite as many people as possible. I want all 30 slots to be filled.

#### If you win the game I host, I will give you anything as long as it is within the $50 threshold.
#### (e.g. 1 year of nitro, a game on steam, a playstation gift card, etc. you name it.)
#### Please make sure I have a way to contact you and send over what is given.

a lot of you guys will be skeptical but i will post receipts to ease your mind.

this is $30. not counting the other nitro giveouts i gave. if this isn't enough i'll just keep on building receipts.
